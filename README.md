# Adoption Website (HTML, CSS, JS)

What is No Paws Left Behind?üêæ
No Paws Left Behind is a platform we have created in order to help hundreds of dogs and cats find their forever homes. Thus, we are not a traditional shelter, we only help people who want to adopt and pets who need a home find their way to each other faster. We post our pet friends‚Äô stories in order to help you get to know them better. Also, we leave contact information so you can talk to the person or the organization who put each furry friend up for adoption.

The adoption website features an intuitive interface showcasing available pets with detailed descriptions and provides user-friendly forms for submitting adoption applications.

(The adoption form was implemented for the first dog.)
