     <font class="subtitlu1"> What is No Paws Left Behind?üêæ</font><br>
      No Paws Left Behind is a platform we have created in order to help hundreds of dogs and cats find their 
      forever homes. Thus, we are not a traditional shelter, we only help people who want to adopt and pets who 
      need a home find their way to each other faster. We post our pet friends‚Äô stories in order to help you 
      get to know them better. Also, we leave contact information so you can talk to the person or the 
      organization who put each furry friend up for adoption.

      <font class="subtitlu1">Why should I adopt?üêï‚Äçü¶∫</font>
      
      <br><font class="subtitlu">1. Because you'll help a pet in need.</font>
      Each year, millions of pets enter shelters and rescues in the United States, many surrendered by loving families who can‚Äôt access pet-friendly housing or veterinary care, while others find their way as victims of cruelty. While the number of animals who are euthanized has dropped drastically over the years due to the hard work of shelter and rescue professionals and a growing number of people who choose adoption, hundreds of thousands are still in need of a home each year. 
      <br><font class="subtitlu">2.Because you'll find a great addition to your family.</font>
Animal shelters and rescue groups are brimming with happy, healthy pets just waiting for someone to take them home. The majority of pets in shelters were brought there because of a severe lack of affordable, pet-friendly housing and access to veterinary care; issues that will require long-term and systemic change. While we work to keep pets and their families together, remember that many of the animals in shelters lived in loving homes and may even come to you house trained and/or ready to live with other pets.  
<br><font class="subtitlu">3. You'll encourage others to adopt from shelters when they see how awesome your own pet is.</font>
Not too long ago, adoption was rare but thanks to decades of advocacy, 
including through a partnership between the Humane Society of the United States, 
Ad Council and Maddie‚Äôs Fund, adoption is now the most popular way to obtain a new pet. 
We want to keep it that way. 
<br><font class="subtitlu">4. Because it's one way to fight puppy mills.</font>
If you buy a dog from a pet store, online seller or flea market, you‚Äôre almost certainly getting a dog from a puppy mill.
Puppy mills are factory-style breeding facilities that put profit above the welfare of dogs. Animals from puppy mills are housed in shockingly poor conditions with improper medical care and are often very sick and behaviorally troubled as a result. The moms of these puppies are kept in cages to be bred over and over for years, without human companionship and with little hope of ever joining a family. And after they're no longer profitable, breeding dogs are simply discarded‚Äîeither killed, abandoned or sold at auction.
These puppy mills continue to stay in business through deceptive tactics ‚Äî their customers are unsuspecting consumers who shop in pet stores, over the Internet or through classified ads. Puppy mills will continue to operate until people stop supporting them. By adopting a pet, you can be certain you aren't giving them a dime.
<br><font class="subtitlu">5. Because pets are good for your health.</font>
Not only do animals give you unconditional love, but they have been shown to be psychologically, emotionally and physically beneficial to their companions. Caring for a pet can provide a sense of purpose and fulfillment and lessen feelings of loneliness. 
<br><font class="subtitlu">6. Because you're helping to build a humane society.</font>
When pets are adopted faster than they arrive at a local shelter, it allows your local organizations to focus on the root causes of pet intake. When they have fewer animals in the building (or in foster homes), they can strengthen programs to reunite lost pets with their families or meet with elected officials to create more pet-friendly housing in your community. Only together can we build a more humane society for pets and people alike.
