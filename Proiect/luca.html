                <p align="justify" id="caracteristici">Hey there, I'm Luca! I love to play and have loads of love to give, especially toward people who take the time to get to know me (and who give me loads of yummy treats!). I am not a dog you use punitive training methods on, though. 
                    The thing is, I am a pretty big boy, and when a big dog like me gets mouthy or growls or barks, it is a lot more scary than when a little dog does it. I have never bitten anyone to the point they were injured, but I do tend to communicate with my mouth, and sometimes when I'm getting annoyed or overstimulated, that's when I start snapping at the air or pressing my mouth against people. I just really need a family that will consistently work with me on my anxiety, continue my inhibition training and that would be okay with me being a single pet, 
                    at least for a little while as I try to get my focus on my training. If you're looking for a special dog or a dog you can truly rescue, I would love to meet you. 
                    I have a ton of energy and can't wait to spend it with my bestest friend ever, I hope that is you!</p>
