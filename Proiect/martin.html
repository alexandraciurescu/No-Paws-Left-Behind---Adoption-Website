                <p align="justify" id="caracteristici">Martin is a senior guy with diabetes! He requires a special diet of diabetic management food and insulin twice daily! He is very easy to administer insulin to because he is so distracted with his dish of canned food in front of him that he doesn‚Äôt even notice the needle.
                    He loves pets and scritches on his head, neck and cheeks! He can be grumpy about pets on some other parts of his body so his foster mom sticks to his head and neck area. He easily purrs with pets and food. He also loves the diabetic management kibble!
                    He is tolerant of other cats but gets annoyed sometimes by the energy of his younger roommate when he buts in front for attention or pushes him out of his food dish.
                    Martin‚Äôs favourite things to do are eating and napping!
                    Martin needs an adult only home!
                    If you are interested in adopting Martin, please contact us at frederictoncarma@gmail.com.
                     
                    I have a ton of energy and can't wait to spend it with my bestest friend ever, I hope that is you!</p>
